    Before you stands a CRYSTAL WARRIOR, one of the Snow Witch's personal 
    guardians who has been sent to deal with you. He is made of quartz which has 
    been animated by the Snow Witch's sorcery. Edged weapons will not harm the 
    Crystal Warrior - your sword is useless! If you possess a war-hammer you may 
    succeed in smashing the Crystal Warrior to pieces.

    If you do not possess a war-hammer, turn to

    If you win, turn to
