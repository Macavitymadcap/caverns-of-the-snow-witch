    You draw your sword and advance towards the old man, asking him why 
    he is so eager to acquire blood-money. You pin him against the wall 
    holding the point of your sword under his chin and ask him to explain 
    why a so-called philanthropic Healer requires 50 Gold Pieces for 
    saving a life. The old man starts to tremble and says, 'All right, 
    I'm sorry, I'm not the Healer. I am only a simple herbalist, down on 
    my luck. I figured that soon you wouldn't be needing your gold 
    anyhow, so you wouldn't mind me having some of it. I realize that it 
    was a foolish thing to do. Listen, you can have some of my own Pills 
    that stop my aches and pains. They might help. No charge of course.' 
    With your sword tip still pinning him up against the wall, he reaches 
    into his robes and pulls out a small bottle. He opens it and hands 
    you three green pills. You grab the pills and leave the hut, telling 
    the old man that he is lucky to be alive. Outside, you have to decide 
    what to do. If you wish to swallow the pills, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/346.html" hx-target="main">346</a>. If you would 
    rather walk back down the path and up the river valley, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/205.html" hx-target="main">205</a>.
