    The Healer looks concerned and says, 'Then you have no alternative, you must 
    walk to Firetop Mountain and climb it alone. This is where we say goodbye.

    for his help. Then, waving goodbye, you squeeze through the crack into the

    halted, you journey north at a fast pace. You are quite close to the foot of 
    the mountain when an ugly creature jumps out from behind a rock to challenge 
    you. It is a HOBGOBLIN and you must fight it.
