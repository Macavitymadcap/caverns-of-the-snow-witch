  <h2>191</h2>

  <p>
    You are so weak that the effort of trying to haul yourself up the vine is 
    too much for you. You lose your grip and fall headlong ten metres down on to 
    the dirt floor and land on a pile of bones. Unable to move and 
    semi-conscious, you feel helpless as hundreds of Flesh Grubs crawl on to you 
    to begin their feast. Your adventure ends here.
