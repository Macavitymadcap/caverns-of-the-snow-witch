  <p>
    Lying at the bottom of the red pot is a square metal disc which you decide 
    to put in your backpack. If you now wish to look inside the grey pot, turn 
    to <a hx-get="/nodes/344.html" hx-target="main">344</a>. 
    If not, you may leave the cavern by the opposite door (turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/176.html" hx-target="main">176</a>).
