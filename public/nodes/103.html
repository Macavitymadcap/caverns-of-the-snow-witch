  <h2>103</h2>

  <p>
    The Mountain Elf looks surprised, and asks why you are not wearing your 
    obedience collar. You see that he is wearing a metal collar round his neck 
    which glows in the semi-darkness, and realize that it must be the collar he 
    is talking about. If you wish to reply that you have put on weight recently 
    and are having your collar widened, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/70.html" hx-target="main">70</a>. 
    If you would rather attack the Elf before he raises the alarm, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/382.html" hx-target="main">382</a>.
