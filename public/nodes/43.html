  <h2>43</h2>
  
  <p>
    You pick up your sword from the floor and search through the clothing of
    the Goblins. You find and take their two daggers, some salted fish, a
    candle and 2 Gold Pieces. The metal collars round their necks have stopped
    glowing, but you cannot remove them. Wondering if any more traps lie beyond
    the ice pit, you try to decide which way to head. If you wish to continue
    down the tunnel, turn to <a hx-get="/nodes/88.html" hx-targe="main">88</a>.
    If you would rather walk back to where the tunnel forked and turn left 
    along the other branch, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/29.html" hx-target="main">29</a>.
