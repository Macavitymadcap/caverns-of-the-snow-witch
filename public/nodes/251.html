    Suddenly Redswift yells and the sound of his short scream wakes you up.
    A huge grey WOLF stands above him, its jaws dripping with saliva.
    Redswift is fighting for his life, but he is no match for a WEREWOLF.
    No, it can't be! You quickly jump to your feet and draw your sword to
    fight the beast.

  <ul class="battle">
    <li>
      WEREWOLF SKILL 9 STAMINA 9
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Fight it. During the third Attack Round the Werewolf will be
    transformed back into a human being. On a roll of 1 or 2 on one die,
    the Werewolf will be Redswift, and you must stop fighting him
    immediately. If you have injured him, you lose 2 <b>LUCK</b> points.
    Turn to <a hx-get="/nodes/327.html" hx-target="main">327</a>. On a roll
    of 3 to 6 on one die, the Werewolf will be an unknown dwarf, and you
    must continue to fight it. If you win, turn to
    <a hx-get="/nodes/199.html" hx-target="main">199</a>.
