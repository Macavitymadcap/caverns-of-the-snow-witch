    The Snow Witch stares at you again before making her choice. 
    This time she calls out 'Star.' You smile and unfold your 
    clenched fist, revealing the circular metal disc. You have 
    outwitted her and she realizes the consequences. The globe 
    starts to fill with white smoke and suddenly it shatters, 
    the image of the Snow Witch disappears completely. Her 
    shrill cry fills the cavern, but she is defeated. The three 
    of you slap each other's hands in celebration. However, your 
    joy is short-lived as you hear an ominous rumbling sound. 
    The ground beneath your feet starts to tremble and huge 
    cracks appear in the ice walls. The roof starts to cave in. 
    Is this the chance to escape that the Snow Witch promised?
