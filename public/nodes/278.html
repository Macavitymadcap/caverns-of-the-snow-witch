    Marching quickly across the plain you do not encounter any 
    evil creatures. To the east, you see the forbidding shape of 
    Firetop Mountain reaching into the sky 'Does the Warlock still 
    rule the depths of Firetop Mountain?' Stubb asks inquisitively. 
    You are just about to reply when you see somebody walking 
    towards you. You draw your sword, but when the person gets 
    closer, you see that it is a little old man carrying a sack 
    over his shoulder. He stops in front of you and says, 
    'Put that sword away, there's no point in killing me. The only 
    thing I have to offer is information - and that costs money. 
    Pay me 2 Gold Pieces and you won't regret it.'

    If you wish to pay the old man for his information, turn to

    If you would rather ignore him and continue south, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/348.html" hx-target="main">348</a>.
