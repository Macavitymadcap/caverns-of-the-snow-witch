  <p>
    You search through the clothing of the Goblins and find some salted 
    fish, a candle and 2 Gold Pieces, which you decide to keep. Both 
    Goblins are wearing metal collars round their necks which you cannot 
    remove. Taking the dagger from the Goblin you slew, you cut hand- and 
    toe-holds into the side of the pit and haul yourself up. Picking up 
    your sword, you decide which way to head, wondering if there are any 
    more traps further down the tunnel. If you wish to continue down it, 
    turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/88.html" hx-target="main">88</a>. If you would 
    rather walk back to where the tunnel forked and turn left along the 
    other branch, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/29.html" hx-target="main">29</a>.
