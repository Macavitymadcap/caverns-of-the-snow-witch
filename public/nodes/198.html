    In the distance you hear chanting voices; before long the tunnel ends at the 
    entrance to a large cavern. Kneeling down before an ice effigy in the shape 
    of a demon, their hooded faces pressed to the ice floor in worship, are ten 
    of the Snow Witch's followers. There are two exits from the cave, one to 
    your left and one to your right. If you are wearing a cloak, turn to

    <a hx-get="/nodes/260.html" hx-target="main">260</a>.
