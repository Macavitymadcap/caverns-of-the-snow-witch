    The flatness of the plain becomes monotonous and you forget to keep a 
    constant lookout. The reflection of the sun on your armour has 
    attracted a group of flying predators that you do not notice circling 
    above you. They are green, with membranous wings, and they swoop 
    down on their prey to kill them with their sharp claws. There are 
    four of these <B>BIRD-MEN</B> above you and one of them suddenly lets 
    out a shrill cry and swoops down to attack you. <i>Test your Luck</i>. 
    If you are Lucky, turn to

    Unlucky, turn to
