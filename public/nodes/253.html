    You look at the Snow Witch's mask in your backpack. It is a grotesque
    replica of the Snow Witch's face, carved out of bone and painted
    white. If you wish to put on the mask, turn to
    <a hx-get="/nodes/376.html" hx-target="main">376</a>. If you do not
    wish to put on the mask, turn to
    <a hx-get="/nodes/260.html" hx-target="main">260</a>.
