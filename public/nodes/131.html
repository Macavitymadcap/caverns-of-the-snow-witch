    Further along the bank you find a small wooden boat tied to a tree. You
    look around but you cannot see its owner. If you wish to take the boat and
    row across the river, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/26.html" hx-target="main">26</a>. If you would rather wait for its owner to arrive, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/289.html" hx-target="main">289</a>.
