  <p>
    You see an overhanging branch, but just fail to grab it. You are carried
    further down the river before being pushed into an inlet where you come to
    a welcome halt. If you were carrying a shield, you would have lost it (lose
    1 <b>SKILL</b> point). You have swallowed lots of water and are completely
    exhausted; you just have enough strength to clamber out of the river on to
    the south bank. Lose 4 <b>STAMINA</b> points. You curse your bad <b>LUCK</b>
    and set off east, back towards the place where the fire was burning (turn
    to <a hx-get="/nodes/50.html" hx-target="main">50</a>).
