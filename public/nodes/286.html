    The Barbarian's only interesting possessions are an engraved 
    copper armband and a leather pouch containing three silver 
    arrow heads. You take the arrow heads and look at the 
    engraving on the armband. On it you can just read the words 
    'Strength is Power'.

    If you wish to wear the armband, turn to

    If you would rather place it in your pocket and continue 
    walking up the gorge, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/319.html" hx-target="main">319</a>.
