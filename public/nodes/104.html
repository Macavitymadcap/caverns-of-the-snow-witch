  <h2>104</h2>

  <p>
    Your journey south is long and arduous, but your determination to leave 
    Icefinger Mountains behind you spurs you on. Two days after leaving the ice 
    caverns, you reach the River Kok. Fifty miles up river lies Fang, the town 
    where Baron Sukumvit's notorious Deathtrap Dungeon awaits its challengers 
    each year for the Trial of Champions. However, at this time of year Fang is 
    unlikely to be more interesting than any other river town. You decide 
    against going there and walk down-river to find a bridge or a boatman. After 
    walking for half an hour along the bank of the wide, dirty-brown river, you 
    see a man asleep aboard a raft moored to the bank. You shout to him and ask 
    him to ferry you across. He tells you to go away as he is too tired to work 
    today. If you wish to offer him 10 Gold Pieces to make him change his mind, 
    turn to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/315.html" hx-target="main">315</a>. 
    If you would rather walk on, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/131.html" hx-target="main">131</a>.
