    Peering into the cave, you see that it runs deep into the side of the hill. 
    Torches cast an eerie light inside the cave, illuminating wooden carvings 
    and masks that are hanging on the walls. You step inside and see a robed 
    figure sitting on the floor with its back to you. Without turning round, the 
    mysterious person says, 'I am the Healer. If you have come to be healed, 
    stand before me now.' Your heart beats faster as you walk over to stand in 
    front of him. Before you is a man who is horribly disfigured; his body is 
    terribly twisted, but he sits there proudly, although pain registers on his 
    face. You tell him that you have been cursed with a Death Spell and have 
    come to be cured. The Healer nods his head and says, 'The power of a Death 
    Spell is difficult to destroy. I have only managed to break it once, and it 
    wasn't easy. A ritual has to be performed which you might not survive. 
    Still, you must try. I will help you as much as I can. First, you must place 
    a Mask of Life over your face to halt the spread of the Death Spell. If you 
    survive the initial battle between life and death, you will be able to face 
    the second stage of the reversal process.' The Healer then takes a strange 
    mask off the wall, carved to symbolize the sun. As you place it over your 
    face, you feel as though your body is being torn apart. Roll 1 die and 
    subtract that number from your <b>STAMINA</b> score. If you are still alive, 
    turn to <a hx-get="/nodes/258.html" hx-target="main">258</a>.
