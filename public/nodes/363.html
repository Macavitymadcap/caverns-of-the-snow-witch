  <h2>363</h2>

  <p>
    You make your way slowly up the mountain until you reach a rock face 
    that is too steep to climb. You walk round the side until you see a 
    massive wall of ice which completely blocks a gully between two peaks 
    of the mountain - the glacier. Your heart leaps as you catch sight 
    of the piece of fur left hanging on the wall of ice by the trapper. 
    Although you cannot see the entrance, you walk straight ahead. You 
    shut your eyes as you think you are about to walk into the wall of 
    ice, but you walk straight through the illusion and find yourself 
    inside a long tunnel carved into the ice. You walk down it and soon 
    arrive at a T-junction. If you wish to turn left, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/395.html" hx-target="main">395</a>. If you wish to 
    turn right, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/215.html" hx-target="main">215</a>.
