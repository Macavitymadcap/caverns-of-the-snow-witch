    As soon as you step into the tunnel, an iron grille drops down behind you,
    barring your retreat. It is impossible to lift and there is nothing you can
    do but find out what lies at the end of the tunnel. You soon arrive at
    another iron grille which blocks your way forward. Beyond the grille the
    tunnels turn left. On the wall opposite, you see a knob which you realize
    must be pressed to lift the iron grille. Unfortunately it is beyond your
    reach, even if you stretch out with your sword. If you have one or more
    daggers, turn to <a hx-get="/nodes/234.html" hx-target="main">234</a>.
    If you have no daggers, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/393.html" hx-target="main">393</a>.
