    As you walk along the edge of the crevasse, the wind starts to howl, 
    blowing flurries of snow into your face. You put your head down and stride
    into the wind. A dark shape suddenly looms out of the curtain of snow. A 
    huge hairy MAMMOTH stands 1 before you, its long tusks curving out 
    threateningly. Trumpeting loudly it lumbers forward to attack.
