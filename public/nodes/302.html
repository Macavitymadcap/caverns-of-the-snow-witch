  <h2>302</h2>

  <p>
    Your head begins to spin and you get double vision. You 
    stagger on, over the edge of the gorge, slipping and 
    sliding on the loose stones. When your legs cannot support 
    your weight any longer, you fall face down, and never get 
    up. The Snow Witch's Death Spell has run its fatal course. 
    Your adventure ends here.
