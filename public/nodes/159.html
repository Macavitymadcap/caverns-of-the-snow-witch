  <p>
    You are now wearing a ring which drains your life force. Roll one die and 
    deduct the number from your <b>SKILL</b> score. Roll two dice and deduct the 
    total from your <b>STAMINA</b> score. If you are still alive, you pull the 
    cursed ring off your finger and crush it beneath your foot. If you have not 
    done so already you may either put on the gold ring (turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/21.html" hx-target="main">21</a>) or the copper ring (turn 
    to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/130.html" hx-target="main">130</a>). Alternatively you 
    may walk through to the next tunnel (turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/338.html" hx-target="main">338</a>).
