  <p>
    As soon as you touch your sword, the Minstrel starts to play a 
    strange high-pitched melody. You are immediately paralysed by the 
    magic notes and can only watch helplessly as the Minstrel reaches 
    into one of the pots to pull out a metal collar, an obedience collar, 
    which he fits around your neck; now you will have to serve the Snow 
    Witch for the rest of your life!
