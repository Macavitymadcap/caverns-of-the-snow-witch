    The tunnel soon ends at a T-junction. Stepping into the cross passage you
    almost bump into a primitive- looking man wearing furs and carrying a 
    large stone club. He is a CAVE-MAN. You draw your sword and tell Redswift
    and Stubb to head quickly down the right-hand tunnel while you deal with 
    the Caveman.

    If you win, turn to 141. You may Escape after two Attack Rounds by running 
    along the tunnel to catch up with Redswift and Stubb (turn to
