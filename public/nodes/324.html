  <h2>324</h2>

  <p>
    Although you get a headache, you are not injured by the fall. As you 
    pick yourself up off the floor, you suddenly hear footsteps coming 
    from the depths of the cave. In the distance you can see a swaying 
    light and the vague outline of a hunched, sinewy figure who skulks 
    slowly forward. If you wish to see who is coming towards you, turn 
    to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/37.html" hx-target="main">37</a>. If you would 
    rather run out of the cave, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/355.html" hx-target="main">355</a>.
