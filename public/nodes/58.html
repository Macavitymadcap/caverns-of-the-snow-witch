  <h2>58</h2>

  <p>
    Lying between the stunted bushes, you listen to the noise of the thundering 
    hooves growing louder. Bending back a branch, you see four CENTAURS gallop 
    by, each armed with a bow and a quiver of arrows. You lie quite still until 
    the sound of their hooves fades. When you are certain that they are out of 
    sight, you stand up and continue your journey south (turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/278.html" hx-target="main">278</a>).
