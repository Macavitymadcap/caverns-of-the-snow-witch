    crack and whistles loudly through his fingers. A few moments later 
    you hear the noise of flapping wings outside and see the Healer 
    smile briefly. 'Tie the silver to its mane and command it to take 
    you to Firetop Mountain,' says the Healer. 'A Pegasus will fly you 
    anywhere for silver. This is where we say goodbye. Good luck, I hope 
    you make it.' You shake the Healer's hand, thanking him over and over 
    again. Then, waving goodbye, you squeeze through the crack into the 
    daylight, Before you stands a magnificent beast. It looks like a 
    white stallion but it has wings. You tie the silver to its mane and 
    climb on to its back. You shout your destination and suddenly you 
    are flying through the air, clinging on to the neck of the mighty 
    Pegasus. It is not long before you reach the mountain and land safely 
    on the summit, which is covered in strange red vegetation. You jump 
    down from the Pegasus and watch it fly off into the distance. You 
    sit down to rest and wait for sunrise (turn to
