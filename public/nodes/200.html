  <h2>200</h2>

  <p>
    The Zombie was probably in charge of the storeroom that the door opens into. 
    Jars and bottles of various shapes and sizes line the walls and many boxes 
    and barrels are stacked up on the floor. You search quickly through them and 
    find little of interest except for a jar of ground minotaur horn, some 
    garlic, a box full of teeth, a jar of pickled lizards' tails and four large 
    dragon eggs. As you will not be able to fit everything into your backpack, 
    you may only take three of the items. Leaving the room, you walk back to the 
    junction and head straight on down the tunnel (turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/150.html" hx-target="main">150</a>).
