  <p>
    In the distance you can hear chanting voices; soon the tunnel ends at the 
    entrance to a large cavern. Kneeling down before an ice effigy in the shape 
    of a demon, with their hooded faces pressed to the ice floor in worship, are 
    ten of the Snow Witch's followers. There are two exits from the cave, one 
    straight ahead and one to your right. If you wish to pretend to be one of 
    the worshippers and walk boldly into the cavern, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/300.html" hx-target="main">300</a>. 
    If you would rather creep cautiously into the cavern, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/283.html" hx-target="main">283</a>.
