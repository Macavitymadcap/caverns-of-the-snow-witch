  <h2>60</h2>

  <p>
    The Snow Witch climbs out of the sarcophagus and walks towards you with her 
    mouth wide open. Her gaze is powerful and you hear a voice in your mind 
    telling you to drop your sword and loosen your collar. Roll two dice. If the 
    total is the same or less than your <b>SKILL</b> score, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/8.html" hx-target="main">8</a>. 
    If the total is higher than your <b>SKILL</b>, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/116.html" hx-target="main">116</a>.
