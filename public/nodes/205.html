  <h2>205</h2>

  <p>
    You spot a small open space between the rocks and trees on the far bank of 
    the river. Something is cooking over a fire, you can see the smoke rising: 
    but there is no one to be seen - perhaps they saw you first and are hiding. 
    The river runs fast and is quite narrow at this point. Large rocks jut out 
    of the river and it would be possible to cross over by leaping from rock to 
    rock. If you wish to cross, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/268.html" hx-target="main">268</a>. 
    If you would rather keep on walking up the river valley, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/115.html" hx-target="main">115</a>.
