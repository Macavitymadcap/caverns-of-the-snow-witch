    As you approach the fire, you smell the delicious aroma of a duck being
    roasted. You draw your sword and walk warily forward. Suddenly a sinewy
    aroma man with long hair and a beard jumps out from behind a rock,
    screaming at the top of his voice. He is wearing animal furs and carrying a
    stone club which he raises to attack you. You must fight the WILD HILL MAN.

    You may Escape after two Attack Rounds by running back across the rocks to
    the north bank of the river (turn to
