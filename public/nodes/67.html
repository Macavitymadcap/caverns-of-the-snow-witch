    You kneel down beside the fur trapper and turn him over slowly. His eyes are 
    barely open and blood trickles down from the corner of his mouth. The Yeti 
    has gouged deep wounds in his chest and you realize that there is no hope of 
    saving him. With a great effort he reaches up and grabs you round the neck, 
    pulling you down so that you can hear his dying words. He thanks you for 
    trying to save him, and insists on telling you his secret. In terrible pain 
    he struggles to whisper his story. He tells you that he has lived in the 
    mountains for most of his life, hunting animals and trading their furs, but 
    for the last five years he has been searching for the legendary Crystal 
    Caves. These caves have been cut out of a glacier by the followers of the 
    Snow Witch, a beautiful yet evil sorceress, who is trying to use her dark 
    powers to bring on an ice age so that she can rule supreme over the whole 
    world. The entrance to the Crystal Caves is high up on this very mountain. 
    It is open, but hidden by an illusion. The unfortunate fur trapper found it 
    by accident only yesterday, when he saw one of the Snow Witch's warriors 
    seemingly walk straight through an ice wall and disappear. The trapper left 
    a piece of fur hanging over the entrance so that he could find it again the 
    next day. Sadly, the Yeti has put an end to his hopes. He asks you to enter 
    the caves to slay the vile Snow Witch and leave her followers without their 
    leader. There are legends about great treasures being frozen into the wall 
    of the Snow Witch's lair which would provide ample reward. The fur trapper 
    suddenly grips you hard and then falls back silently into the snow - he's 
    dead. You cover him with snow, before deciding what to do. 50 Gold Pieces 
    await you if you return with evidence of the Yeti's death to Big Jim Sun; 
    but the thought of a quest through the Crystal Caves beneath Icefinger 
    Mountains excites you, and you decide to set off to find them (turn to
