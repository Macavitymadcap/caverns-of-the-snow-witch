  <h2>3</h2>

  <p>
    By some miracle, you are not hit by the heavy chunks of falling ice. When 
    they finally stop crashing around you, you are surprised to see the 
    welcome sight of blue sky above. The three of you waste no time clambering 
    out of the ice cavern, and you find yourselves on the side of the mountain. 
    It is not even snowing and everything looks tranquil. As you climb down the 
    mountain, you tell your friends about Big Jim Sun and the circumstances 
    that led you to enter the caverns of the Snow Witch. You realize that Big 
    Jim would have presumed you were dead; and you decide it is not worth 
    chasing after him to collect your reward for killing the Yeti. Without 
    any further ado you agree to accompany Redswift and Stubb to 
    Stonebridge (turn to
