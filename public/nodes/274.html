  <h2>274</h2>

  <p>
    The Mountain Elf looks at you in disbelief and says, 'Nobody of good heart
    would wish to join the Snow Witch. I am only here because of this!'
    Throwing back his hood, the Elf reveals a metal collar around his neck
    which glows in the semi-darkness. 'Only the obedience collar makes me
    serve her,' he continues in a dour voice. If you wish to reiterate your 
    desire to join the Snow Witch, turn to
    <a hx-get="/nodes/22.html" hx-target="main">22</a>. If you would rather 
    change your story and tell the elf you intend to slay her, turn to
    <a hx-get="/nodes/264.html" hx-target="main">264</a>.
