    Ash fires a perfect shot: his arrow pierces the head of the diving Death 
    Hawk. Its wings stop beating and it crashes into the side of the hill. The 
    other side of the hill slopes down into a gorge and Ash tells you that you 
    must now journey alone to meet the Healer. He tells you to walk east up the 
    gorge until you see the head of a phoenix carved in the rock. The Healer 
    lives in a cave in the side of the hill above the carved rock. You thank Ash 
    for his help and walk slowly down the hill into the gorge. At the bottom you 
    follow Ash's instructions and turn left up the gorge (turn to
