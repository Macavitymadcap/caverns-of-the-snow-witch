    The footpath twists and turns through the trees before ending outside a 
    wooden hut. You creep up to the hut and look through the window. An old man 
    wearing purple robes and a grey skull cap is asleep in an ornately carved 
    rocking-chair. The shelves on the wall behind him are lined with jars of 
    herbs and berries. If you wish to enter the hut, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/341.html" hx-target="main">341</a>. 
    If you would rather walk back down the path to continue up the valley, turn 
    to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/205.html" hx-target="main">205</a>.
