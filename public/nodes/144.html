    You ask the Centaurs if they saw any monsters during their gallop north
    across the Pagan Plain. Their leader looks at you sternly and says, 'No.'
    Seeing your wounds and bulging backpack, he asks if you have just returned
    from a treasure hunt. If you wish to reply that you have, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/272.html" hx-target="main">272</a>. If you wish to reply
    that you were attacked by Dark Elves crossing the River Kok and your
    backpack contains merely their helmets and broken weapons, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/233.html" hx-target="main">233</a>.
