  <p>
    As soon as you step on to the black footprints you feel a strange sensation. 
    Your whole body starts to vibrate and your legs feel so weak that you think 
    you are about to collapse. You press on resolutely, but when you step past 
    the final footprint you still feel as though your body has been drained of 
    some of its strength. Lose 1 <b>SKILL</b> point and 3 <b>STAMINA</b> 
    points. Cursing the bewitched caverns you press on down the tunnel (turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/207.html" hx-target="main">207</a>).
