    One of the Hill Trolls looks up and sees you walking by. He 
    gives a cry of alarm and the three of them run out of the 
    trees to attack. You have to fight two of them.

  <ul class="battle">
    <li>
      First HILL TROLL SKILL 8 STAMINA 9
    </li>
    <li>
      Second HILL TROLL SKILL 9 STAMINA 9
    </li>
  </ul>

    Fight them both at the same time. During each Attack Round, 
    they will both make a separate attack on you, but you must 
    choose which one you will fight. Attack your chosen Hill 
    Troll as in a normal battle. Against the other one you will 
    throw for your Attack Strength in the normal way, but you 
    will not wound it if your Attack Strength is greater; you 
    must just count this as though you have defended yourself 
    against its blow. Of course, if its Attack Strength is 
    greater, it will wound you. If you defeat them both, turn 
    to
