    The Goblins are well practised in the art of dagger-throwing and both hit
    you, one in the shoulder and one in the back of your thigh. Lose 4 
    <b>STAMINA</b> points and 1 <b>SKILL</b> point. You stop briefly to pull
    the daggers out and throw them back at the Goblins before running painfully
    on (turn to <a hx-get="/nodes/29.html" hx-target="main">29</a>).
