  <p>
    Lying at the bottom of the grey pot is an old parchment scroll with 
    an unbroken wax seal. If you wish to break the seal and read the 
    scroll, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/224.html" hx-target="main">224</a>. If not, you 
    may either look inside the red pot (turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/101.html" hx-target="main">101</a>), or leave the 
    cavern by the door opposite (turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/176.html" hx-target="main">176</a>)
