    The red leaves all around you emit a sweet smell which you find very
    pleasant. You feel very relaxed and suddenly have trouble keeping your eyes
    open, even though it is only early evening. You are una- ware that you are
    lying on SLEEPING GRASS. You sink into a deep sleep, full of vivid and
    exciting dreams. Night falls and time passes by, but you cannot wake up.
    The moon drifts slowly across the clear night sky until dawn is only
    minutes away. A tiny image disturbs your dreams but it is difficult to make
    out; it grows steadily larger, until the flashing image fills your mind. A
    bird with a long beak and fine plumage is trying to fly out of a circle of
    flames. The Healer is trying to wake you. If you can focus your mind and
    remember the name of this bird which is the symbol of the Healer's power,
    your dreams will end and you will be able to rouse yourself. If you believe
    the bird to be a Phoenix, turn to 146. If you believe the bird to be a
    Griffin, turn to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/228.html" hx-target="main">228</a>.
