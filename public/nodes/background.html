  <p>
    Winters in northern Allansia are always cruel and bitter. The snow falls
    thick and the icy wind blows hard, chilling everybody to the bone. For the
    past few weeks you have been hired by a merchant called Big Jim Sun to 
    protect his trading caravans as they roll their way slowly north to the 
    frozen outposts The horse-drawn carts are laden with cloth, utensils, 
    weapons, salted meats, spices and tea, which are traded for furs and ivory 
    carvings made from mammoths' tusks. Big Jim is not usually worried about 
    travelling north,as bandits only attack his caravans on the return journey 
    - he is not alone in recognizing the value of the northern goods.

    On this particular trip you are walking ahead of six carts across a frozen 
    lake. In the distance you can see the snow-capped peaks of the Icefinger 
    Mountains jutting out of low cloud. Your destination lies at the base of 
    the mountains where the Northmen meet to trade. Snow is falling, but not 
    too heavily. You stop to prod the ice with your sword to make sure it can 
    bear the weight of carts, when suddenly the shrill call of a hunting horn 
    breaks the silence. You stand up and run back to the carts to talk to Big 
    Jim. He is sitting next to the driver of the second cart, puffing on a 
    long briar pipe. A huge man, with a great bushy beard, Big Jim is obviously
    a man to be reckoned with. His bright blue eyes scan the horizon, searching 
    for signs of life. In a deep voice he says, 'Sounds like it came from the 
    outpost. Reckon you better go and investigate. Could be trouble. And get 
    back quick'.

    You set off straight away towards the outpost at the base of Icefinger 
    Mountains. You arrive two hours later at a scene of ugly carnage. The 
    snow is red with blood and all the wooden huts are smashed and torn down. 
    Six men lie dead, their bodies slashed, their axes at their sides in the 
    snow. Judging by the size of the footprints the creature that attacked the
    outpost must have been enormous. There is nothing you can do for the 
    unfortunate Northmen, so you head back towards Big Jim's Caravan to report 
    the news. You reach them 1n an hour, just as the daylight is fading, and 
    relate the terrible events that have befallen the outpost. BiS Jim orders 
    the carts to be drawn into a circle to protect his men during the night. A 
    large fire is built into the centre of the circle and you sit down beside 
    it to talk to Big Jim. Everybody iS nervous and a guard is posted to watch 
    for signs of movement outside. In a low voice Big Jim asks you if you will 
    hunt the terrible creature, for otherwise his business will be ruined 
    forever. You smile and reply that you will track down the beast, but only 
    for a purse of 50 Gold Pieces. Big Jim's jaw drops open, and it takes a 
    great deal of persuasion before he agrees to your demand. The snow finally 
    stops falling as you settle down for the night; sleep is a long time coming, 
    for your mind is active with thoughts of the impending hunt. 
  </p>

  <p>
    When you wake just after dawn, the fire is reduced to dying embers. Wisps 
    of smoke rise gently into the morning mist and not a sound is to be heard. 
    You walk over to where Big Jim is sleeping and tap him on the shoulder. He 
    wakes with a start and you tell him that you are setting off and hope to be 
    back later in the day. You wave to the guard as the snow starts to fall 
    again, and make your way back to the outpost.
