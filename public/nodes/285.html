    The door opens into another tunnel which leads off into the 
    distance. Stubb begins to complain about being tired and 
    hungry, so you decide to sit down and rest. If you still 
    have three portions of your Provisions, you eat one yourself 
    and give one each to Redswift and Stubb. After resting for 
    half an hour, you set off again and eventually the tunnel 
    ends at a T-junction.
