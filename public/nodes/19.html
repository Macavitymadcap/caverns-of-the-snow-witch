    The Healer is right behind you, urging you to hurry through the cave. You 
    walk on in silence until you see sunlight streaming through a crack at the 
    end of the cave. You see that the crack is just wide enough for you to 
    squeeze through, and you ask the Healer, 'What will happen next?' He 
    calmly replies, 'This is as far as I go. The final part of your ordeal you
    must face alone. Wearing your mask, you must be at the summit of Firetop
    Mountain before dawn to watch the sunrise. You must sit cross-legged 
    facing east - you will be totally cured the moment the first rays of 
    sunlight come up over the horizon. If you have something made of silver, 
    we will be able to attract a <b>PEGASUS</b> to fly you there.' If you 
    possess any silver object, turn to

    If you do not have any silver, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/328.html" hx-target="main">206</a>.
