  <p>
    The Death Spell is not working as quickly on you as it is on Redswift. You
    help him to his feet, apologiz- ing that you made him read the infernal
    spell. He tells you not to worry about it, he was as good as dead anyway
    as a slave in the ice caverns. You manage to struggle on for another
    hour, carrying poor Redswift on your back. Suddenly his fingers dig into
    your arm and then his whole body relaxes; the Death Spell has won. After
    burying your elfin friend in a leafy glade, you set off as quickly as you
    can towards the Moonstone Hills. But you are weak and cannot walk very
    fast. Lose 1 <b>SKILL</b> point and 1 <b>STAMINA</b> point. The ground
    becomes steeper as you approach the foothills, and you wonder which way
    you should go to find the Healer. If you wish to continue east following
    the river into the hills, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/46.html" hx-target="main">46</a>. If you would rather
    cross the river by the rope bridge ahead of you, and walk south along the
    base of the hills for a while, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/385.html" hx-target="main">385</a>.
