  <h2>115</h2>

  <p>
    Through the trees to your left, you see a tall man with pointed ears and 
    fair hair. He is wearing a green cloak and he is busy carving arrow shafts 
    with his knife. He is an ELF, similar in appearance to Redswift. If you wish 
    to ask him if he knows where the Healer lives, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/100.html" hx-target="main">100</a>. 
    If you would rather attack him with your sword, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/397.html" hx-target="main">397</a>.
