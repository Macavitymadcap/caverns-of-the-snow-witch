    Walking slowly and carefully, you reach the other side of the pit, much to 
    your relief. The Healer walks casually across the log as though the pit was 
    not there. 'Good', he says, 'now you must prepare yourself for the next 
    stage. In order to survive, you must be totally calm. If you have a dragon's

    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/271.html" hx-target="main">271</a>.
