    You quickly gather your thoughts and remember that a Vampire can only be 
    killed by driving a Stake through its heart. If you possess a carved rune 
    stick, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/7.html" hx-target="main" >7</a>. If 
    not, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/121.html" hx-target="main">121</a>.
