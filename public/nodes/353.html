    his finger and the lid clicks open. Inside the casket is a pair of 
    grey skin boots. 'Boots of the elder elves,' he says with glee, 
    'what treasure - nobody knows how to make these any more. No matter 
    what surface you are walking on, no one will hear you, if you are 
    wearing these boots. Let us draw lots again to decide who shall wear 
    them.' If you roll a 1 or 2, turn to

    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/265.html" hx-target="main">265</a>. If you roll a 5 
    or 6, turn to
