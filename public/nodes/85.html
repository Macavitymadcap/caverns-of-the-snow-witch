    By the time you reach the top of the hill, you are panting very heavily. 
    Lose 1 <b>STAMINA</b> point. You are so exhausted, that you do not look 
    about you, and only hear Ash's warning cry as a DEATH HAWK dives down to 
    attack you. Ash fires an arrow at the bird of prey. Ash's skill is 9. Roll 
    two dice. If the total is the same or less than Ash's <b>SKILL</b>, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/175.html" hx-target="main">175</a>. 
    If the total is greater than Ash's <b>SKILL</b>, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/238.html" hx-target="main">238</a>.
