  <h2>180</h2>

  <p>
    The thundering noise of galloping hooves grows louder and four CENTAURS come 
    into view. Each one is armed with a bow and quiver of arrows. They stop 
    almost at once in a line before you, keen-eyed and ready for any move on 
    your part. Their leader is obviously the one with the ugly blue scar running 
    down his face and chest, as he is also proudly carrying a spear and a 
    shield, and wearing a horned helmet. If you wish to offer to pay them to 
    take you to Stonebridge, turn to

    If you would rather just talk to them briefly and be on your way, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/144.html" hx-target="main">144</a>.
