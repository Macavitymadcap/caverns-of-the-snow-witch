    You examine the wooden chest lying on the floor and decide to prise it open
    with your sword. Inside you find three ornate rings and a cracked bottle
    which emits a sweet odour. If you wish to try on any of the rings, turn to
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/65.html" hx-target="main">65</a>. If you would rather 
    walk through to the next tunnel, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/338.html" hx-target="main">338</a>.
