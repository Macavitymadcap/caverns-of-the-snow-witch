    The other Bird-men, who were circling above you, fly east after seeing the
    first Bird-man killed. Frightened that they might return with a huge flock, 
    you decide to run across the plain. The sun is now overhead and you begin 
    to sweat profusely. You become unbearably thirsty and curse the fact that 
    you have not got a water-bottle. You finally reach a water-hole, but you 
    feel like screaming when you see the body of an <b>OGRE</b> lying face down 
    in the water. If you wish to drink the water, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/302.html" hx-target="main">301</a>. If you would rather 
    resist the temptation to drink, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/63.html" hx-target="main">63</a>.
