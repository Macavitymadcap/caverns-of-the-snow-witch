    The energy bolt which hits the globe sends out a brilliant flash of
    light that makes you turn your head away. You open your eyes to find
    that the Snow Witch has vanished! You are momentarily stunned by the
    Snow Witch's disappearance. Suddenly you hear the sound of shuffling
    footsteps coming from the tunnel opposite. An Elf and a Dwarf enter
    the cavern: they look almost identical to Redswift and Stubb except
    that their vacant looks and putrid white flesh indicate that they are
    both ZOMBIES. The Snow Witch has unleashed her magical powers to make
    you fight the terrible replicas of your friends.

  <ul class="battle">
    <li>
      DWARF ZOMBIE SKILL 8 STAMINA 9
    </li>
    <li>
      ELF ZOMBIE SKILL 9 STAMINA 9
    </li>
  </ul>

    Fight both the Zombies at the same time. During each Attack Round,
    they will both make a separate attack on you, but you must choose
    which of the two you will fight. Attack your nominated target as in
    a normal battle. Against the other, you will throw for your Attack
    Strength in the normal way, but you will not wound it if your Attack
    Strength is greater; you must count this as though you have just
    parried its blow. Of course, if its Attack Strength is greater, it
    will have wounded you in the normal way. If you win, turn to
