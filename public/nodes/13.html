    By mid-morning Stubb has become quite excited, knowing that he will soon be
    home. Seconds later, the thought of his dead friend Morri depresses him 
    and he shakes his fist at the unseen Hill Trolls. An hour later you see 
    distant wisps of smoke rising into the sky. 'Stonebridge!' yells Stubb. He
    starts to run ahead of you, but suddenly stops when he sees a party of 
    six HILL TROLLS marching towards his village. Screaming a dwarfish 
    battle-cry, he raises his axe and charges at them. You cannot leave your 
    friend to fight them on his own and run forward to fight at his side. Two
    of the Hill Trolls turn to fight you.

  <ul class="battle">
    <li>
      First HILL TROLL SKILL 9 STAMINA 10
    </li>

    <li>
      Second HILL TROLL SKILL 9 STAMINA 9
    </li>
  </ul>

    Fight them both at the same time. During each Attack Round, they will both
    make a separate attack on you, but you must choose which of the two you 
    will fight. Attack your chosen Hill Troll as in a normal battle. Against 
    the other you will throw for your Attack Strength in the normal way, but 
    you will not wound it if your Attack Strength is greater; you must just 
    count this as though you have defended yourself against its blow. Of 
    course, if its Attack Strength is greater, it will wound you. If you 
    defeat them both, turn to
