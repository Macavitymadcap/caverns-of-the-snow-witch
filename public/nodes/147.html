    Before the writing fades away you learn a spell which will protect you 
    against an attack by an Air Elemental. Add 1 LUCK point, You memorize the

    done so already, you may either look inside the red pot (turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/101.html" hx-target="main">101</a>) or leave the cavern

    <a hx-het="/nodes/176/html" hx-target="main">176</a>).
