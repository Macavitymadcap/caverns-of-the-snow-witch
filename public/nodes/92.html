  <h2>92</h2>

  <p>
    You walk round a large boulder and see a huge man sleeping in the shade. He 
    is lying on top of some animal skins, snoring loudly. His two-handed 
    battleaxe lies propped up against the boulder. He is a BARBARIAN and it 
    would be foolish to wake him up, so you decide to tiptoe past him. If you 
    are wearing elfin boots, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/128.html" hx-target="main">128</a>. 
    If you are wearing ordinary boots, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/374.html" hx-target="main">374</a>.
