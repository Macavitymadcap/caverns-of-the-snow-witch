    Ignoring a dark cave entrance at the foot of the mountain, you begin the 
    difficult climb up the steep face. You suddenly slip and fall when a piece 
    of rock comes away in your hand. <i>Test your Luck</i>. If you are Lucky, 
    turn to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/284.html" hx-target="main">284</a>. 
    If you are Unlucky, you will plunge to your death down the side of Firetop 
    Mountain.
