    The three of you set off to the south, worried about the shortage of water. 
    Stubb tries to offer some comfort by saying that you should reach 
    Stonebridge in less than a day. He says that he is surprised that he hasn't 
    seen any of his fellow Dwarfs by now. 'Oh yes we have,' says Redswift 
    solemnly, 'but you won't want to see them like that.' He points to a 
    boulder about 50 metres west. The bloodied body of a Dwarf lies propped up 
    against it, his head has slumped forward, and he is motionless. His axe is 
    still in his hand, and whoever or whatever attacked him cannot be far away. 
    Stubb runs up to the Dwarf wailing in grief. 'It's Morri the Ironsmith,' he 
    says. 'This looks like the work of Hill Trolls. Let's bury Morri and get to 
    Stonebridge as quickly as possible to tell them this terrible news. Here, 
    take Morri's water-bottle. He won't need it now.' You gulp down the water 
    and are at last refreshed. Add 1 <b>STAMINA</b> point. After marking 
    Morri's grave with his axe and helmet, you set off again for Stonebridge 
    (turn to <a hx-get="/nodes/110.html" hx-target="main">110</a>).
