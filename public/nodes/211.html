    Stubb's desire for revenge spurs him on and he quickly defeats two of the 
    Hill Trolls, and then helps Redswift dispatch the remaining two. He does not 
    stop to search through the Trolls' belongings, but heads straight for 
    Stonebridge. You follow him into the village where he is greeted by all his 
    old friends. However, you soon discover that an air of gloom hangs over the 
    Dwarfs. Even though they know that the Hill Trolls are gathering to attack 
    their village, they have lost their will to defend themselves since their 
    fabled war-hammer was stolen from King Gillibran. Stubb is concerned by 
    their loss of morale and takes you to the inn to meet his friend Bigleg. He 
    learns from Bigleg that an eagle took the war-hammer but dropped it over 
    Darkwood Forest. 'Then we must find it. Bigleg, we must leave immediately,' 
    says Stubb, forgetting his own troubles. He stands up and extends his hand 
    to you, saying, 'Well, friends, I'm sorry, but I will not be able to offer 
    you our hospitality after all. I hope you understand.' He walks out of the 
    inn with Bigleg and that is the last that you see of the jolly old Dwarf. 
    Redswift sighs and suggests that the two of you leave for Moonstone Hills 
    straight away. Besides, he says, he has something important to tell you and 
    in a way it is fortunate that Stubb will not be around to hear what he has 
    to say. Intrigued by Redswift's words, you leave Stonebridge, heading east 
    along the bank of Red River. While keeping a lookout for Hill Troll patrols, 
    you cannot help wondering what it is that Redswift has to tell you. Hidden 
    among the trees to your left, Redswift suddenly spots three Hill Trolls 
    sharpening their weapons on a stone. <i>Test your Luck</i>. If you are
