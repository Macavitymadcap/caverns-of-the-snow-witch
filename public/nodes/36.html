    The front door of the hut is frozen shut and you have to batter it with your
    shoulder to open it. There is only one room inside the hut containing the
    belongings of a fur trapper. Traps, furs and sacks are stacked in a corner 
    of the room. A wooden bed, a table and chair and some cooking utensils show
    signs of recent use, and the ashes in the fire are still warm. If you wish
    to put some logs on the fire and warm up the cold stew in one of the pans,
    turn to <a hx-get="/nodes/118.html" hx-target="main">118</a>. If you would
    rather leave the hut and continue your quest, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/192.html" hx-target="main">192</a>.
