  <p>
    As you climb down inside the dark depths of the hollow tree, you 
    suddenly feel cold, clammy, maggot-like larvae slithering up the 
    vine. They are as big as your finger and they crawl on to your body 
    and bare arms, but you cannot brush them off for fear of falling. 
    In the dark, you don't see their blind heads writhing about, but you 
    feel the pain when one burrows its hook-like teeth into your arm. 
    You are covered with <B>FLESH GRUBS</B>. In blind panic, you try to 
    haul yourself up the vine, the effect of the Death Spell making it 
    a terrible effort. If your <B>STAMINA</B> is 6 or less, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/191.html" hx-target="main">191</a>. If your 
    <B>STAMINA</B> is greater than 6, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/222.html" hx-target="main">222</a>.
