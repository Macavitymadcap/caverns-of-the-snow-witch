  <h2>370</h2>

  <p>
    You are almost at the entrance to the tunnel when the worshippers stop 
    their chanting. They stand up and one of them calls out to you 
    asking why you did not stop to sing the praises of The Frozen One. If 
    you have a magic flute, you can tell them that you have been ordered 
    to go and play it for the Snow Witch (turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/31.html" hx-target="main">31</a>). Otherwise you 
    may either fight them (turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/143.html" hx-target="main">143</a>), or try to run 
    for the tunnel (turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/33.html" hx-target="main">33</a>).
