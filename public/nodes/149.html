    You open your backpack and reluctantly pay the man 50 Gold Pieces. Still 
    smiling, he takes a jar from a shelf and pours the contents into a pan of 
    soup which is simmering on an open fire in his kitchen. He fills a bowl with 
    his herbal remedy and hands it to you, saying, 'That should do the job. It 
    will take about an hour to work, so I suggest you go and lie down in the sun 
    by the river. You'll soon be feeling much better.' You gulp down the soup, 
    thank him curtly, and walk back down the footpath to find a spot to rest 
    (turn to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/209.html" hx-target="main">209</a>).
