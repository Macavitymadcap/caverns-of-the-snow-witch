  <p>
    The guardian of the Snow Witch's treasure is dead and you are free to help 
    yourself to her riches, although there is a limit to how much you can carry. 
    You decide to fill your backpack with Gold Pieces, and you count 600 in all. 
    However, for each 50 you take, you will have to remove one item from your 
    backpack and leave it behind. Adjust your Equipment List accordingly. Just 
    as you finish filling your backpack, you hear the sound of running feet 
    coming down the tunnel towards the chamber. You stand up and draw your 
    sword, wondering if you can survive much more hard combat. Two men suddenly 
    appear at the door, a Dwarf and an Elf, but they do not look as though they 
    are about to attack you. They are smiling broadly and they both try to speak 
    at once, the Elf finally taking command. 'You have killed her! We are free! 
    We will soon be able to take off our obedience collars! Now we wish to repay 
    you, friend, by helping you to escape. You cannot leave the caverns by the 
    way you came, because the Snow Witch's followers are waiting for you, and 
    the tunnels are alive with Goblins. Our fellow Elves and Dwarfs are battling 
    against them now, to give you time to flee - we must waste no more time.' To 
    your surprise the Elf walks straight towards the cavern wall opposite the 
    door, and appears to pass right through it. 'Another of the Snow Witch's 
    illusions,' comments the Dwarf, 'an escape route she never got the chance to 
    use. The trouble is, we've never used it either.' The Dwarf laughs to 
    himself and walks towards the wall, you following behind. Walking through 
    the illusion you find yourself in a narrow torchlit tunnel which you walk 
    down in single file. It soon ends at a junction and you discuss which way to 
    turn. If you wish to turn left, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/61.html" hx-target="main">61</a>. 
    If you would rather turn right, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/388.html" hx-target="main">388</a>.
