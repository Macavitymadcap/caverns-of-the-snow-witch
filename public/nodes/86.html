    The Goblins release the rope and stand at the top of the pit, laughing at 
    your useless attempt to trick them. Your predicament is now worse than ever; 
    trapped at the bottom of an ice pit without even your sword. Lose 2 
    <b>LUCK</b> points. You sigh and call to the Goblins, asking them to catch 
    the rope as you throw it up to them again. They take hold of it and you 
    climb up out of the pit. The Goblins are dressed in furs and are also 
    wearing glowing metal collars round their necks. They motion you to walk 
    back down the tunnel, urging you on with the points of their daggers. You 
    realize that you are doomed unless you try to escape. If you wish to fight 
    them with your bare hands, turn to

    If you would rather try to run away, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/102.html" hx-target="main">102</a>.
