    The Elf asks you why you are looking for the Healer. You tell him about your 
    battles in the ice caverns, the Death Spell and how poor Redswift met his 
    end. 'Redswift!' cries the Elf. 'He's my brother!' He explains that his name 
    is Ash and he never knew that his brother had been enslaved by the Snow 
    Witch. Suddenly, saddened by the news of Redswift's death, he walks away and 
    stands silently in the sunlight. After a few minutes, he says, 'I will help 
    you to find the Healer but you will have to face him alone, because he will 
    only make contact with the sick. He was disfigured and cursed with disease 
    and pain by The Dark Ones, the evil spirits of the night, for ridding a 
    wizard named Nicodemus of a Death Spell they had cast on him. Now he 
    practises his work in the solitude of the hills. Follow me, it looks as if 
    we have no time to lose.' Ash walks ahead of you, constantly alert for 
    danger. You climb up the valley for an hour before reaching a rope bridge 
    which spans the river. Ash says that you will have to cross the bridge. You 
    tell him that you will have to rest first as the Death Spell continues to 
    drain your life force. Lose 1 <b>STAMINA</b> point. Later you tell Ash that 
    you are ready to continue and step on to the bridge. You are about half-way 
    across when you suddenly hear voices shouting. You look around and see two 
    HILL TROLLS cutting the ropes which secure the bridge to its supports. You 
    hurry as fast as you can towards the far bank. <i>Test your Luck</i>. If
