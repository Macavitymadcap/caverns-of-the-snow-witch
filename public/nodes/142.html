  <h2>142</h2>
  
  <p>
    Ash is strong enough to keep hold of the rope bridge with one hand and to
    grab you with his other hand to stop you from being swept away downstream.
    He manages to drag you up on to the far bank, but the ordeal costs you 1
    <b>STAMINA</b> point. Without waiting for you to recover he urges you to
    follow him along the footpath which leads up the side of the hill away from
    the bridge (turn to <a hx-get="/nodes/85.html" hx-target="main">85</a>).
