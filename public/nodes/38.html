    Even though it is quite cool walking along the bank of the Red River, you
    start to sweat and feel dizzy. You look at Redswift and he, too, looks far
    from well. His face is white and his eyes look dark and sunken. 'Sit down,'
    says Redswift in a laboured voice. You gratefully stop and collapse on to
    the grass, quite worried now as your heart is beating very fast. 'Do you
    remember walking through the caverns of the Snow Witch and arriving at a
    door with a piece of parchment nailed to it? You could not understand what
    was written on it and asked me to read it. It was a Death Spell and we are
    now both doomed. It is starting to work on us sooner than I expected. We
    have to find the old man of the hills that they call the Healer. Only he
    can save us now But I fear it may be too late already. My legs are so
    weak, I don't know if I'll be able to stand again.' If you drank the
    Potion of Health that belonged to the Dark Elf, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/30.html" hx-target="main">30</a>. If you did not drink
    this Potion, turn to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/367.html" hx-target="main">367</a>.
