    The iron ball flies through the air and hits the Frost Giant on the temple. 
    His huge frame crumples to the floor like a house of cards. The wooden 
    chest he was lifting breaks open, spilling its contents. You find three 
    ornate rings and a cracked bottle which emits a sweet, scented odour. If 
    you wish to try on any of the rings, turn to

    If you would rather walk through to the next tunnel, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/338.html" hx-target="main">338</a>.
