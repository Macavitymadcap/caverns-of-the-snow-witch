  <h2>400</h2>

  <p>
    It is the beginning of a beautiful day. A day which is probably going 
    to be the most enjoyable of your life. The spirit of the evil Snow 
    Witch has been destroyed and you are cured of her terrible curse. As 
    you climb down the mountain, you think about the kind, unselfish 
    Healer, and of your friends Redswift and Stubb. You are suddenly 
    eager to meet the jolly old Dwarf again and set off towards 
    Stonebridge as fast as you can, hoping that he will have returned 
    from Darkwood Forest. You have earned yourself a welcome rest, 
    although whether or not you will get it is another story.
