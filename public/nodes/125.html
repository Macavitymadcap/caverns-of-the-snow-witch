  <h2>125</h2>
  
  <p>
    The tunnel through the glacier soon leads into the mountainside itself and
    the walls change from ice to bare rock. You enter a large cavern which has
    three other exits leading from it; one to your left, one to your right and
    the main one, carved as a giant skull, lying directly opposite. As you
    enter, an ugly robed man steps out of the mouth of the skull, holding a
    glass prism in his outstretched hands. He com- mands you to turn back as
    only the Snow Witch's personal servants are allowed inside the mountain. If
    you have a magic flute you may wish to tell him that you have been asked to
    come and play it for the Snow Witch (turn to

    him with your sword (turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/156.html" hx-target="main">156</a>).
