  <p>
    As you draw your sword, the Gnome yells an order to the dull-witted 
    NEANDERTHAL, telling him to kill you. The Neanderthal grunts and stands up, 
    pushing the table away from him. He picks up a carving knife and a stool as 
    a shield and lumbers forward to attack.

  <ul class="battle">

      NEANDERTHAL SKILL 7 STAMINA 5
    </li>
  </ul>
