    The Gnome runs up to you and shouts, 'Get out, dinner will not be ready for 
    another two hours. You'll hear the bell. Mind you, you look a little worse 
    for wear, so you can have this stale cake if you wish.' The Gnome points at 
    a piece of cake lying on the table. If you wish to take the cake and leave, 
    turn to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/290.html" hx-target="main">290</a>. 
    If you would rather attack the Snow Witch's servants, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/187.html" hx-target="main">187</a>.
