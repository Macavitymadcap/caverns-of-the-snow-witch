    You suddenly hear a woman howling terribly in the depths of the cave. Her 
    mournful wail rises to a horrible, bitter scream. The Healer whispers to you 
    that the cries come from a BANSHEE, a hideous spectre whose face and hands 
    are shrivelled and who only has one large nostril and a single tooth. He 
    tells you that if you walk by her without fear, you will come to no harm. 
    'Do not speak to her, touch her or even acknowledge her presence. She cannot 
    harm you if you obey my instructions. I will be right behind you, but do not 
    worry about me,' the Healer says calmly. You walk further into the cave 
    until the dreaded Banshee comes into view. She looks even worse than the 
    Healer's description with her red-rimmed eyes and stooping posture. You try 
    to remain calm but feel the blood racing through your veins. She stands 
    immediately in front of you as you try to walk by, letting out the most 
    doom-laden howl you have ever heard in your life. You are tempted to look 
    into her face and cut her down with your sword. If you have drunk the 
    dragon's egg concoction, turn to

    If you have not drunk this concoction, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/333.html" hx-target="main">333</a>.
