  <h2>70</h2>

  <p>
    The Mountain Elf laughs and says he never puts on any weight, but if he was 
    fortunate enough to be able to take off his collar he might try to run away. 
    He has hardly finished the sentence when he screams in pain. He tries in 
    vain to pull the obedience collar from his neck, begging forgiveness at the 
    top of his voice from an unseen master. He finally stops screaming and 
    slumps to the floor, his face dripping with sweat. You ask him if he is all 
    right, but he does not respond. Lose 1 <b>LUCK</b> point. You decide to 
    leave him and press on down the tunnel (turn to
