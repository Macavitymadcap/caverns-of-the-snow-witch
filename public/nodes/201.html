    You see an overhanging branch and just manage to grab it with one hand. If 
    you are carrying a shield, you will have to let it drop into the river (lose 
    1 <b>SKILL</b> point) so that you can haul yourself out. Summoning all your 
    remaining strength, you manage to pull yourself up on to the south bank of 
    the river. You feel totally exhausted. Lose 2 <b>STAMINA</b> points. You 
    curse the Snow Witch and set off east, back towards the place where the fire 
    was burning (turn to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/50.html" hx-target="main">50</a>).
