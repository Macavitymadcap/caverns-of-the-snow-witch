    You look up and see great cascades of snow tumbling down the mountainside. 
    With horror you realize that you are standing in the path of the avalanche. 
    You look around and see an outcrop under which you could shelter. The 
    approaching mass of snow is no more than a hundred metres away and you 
    struggle to run for cover. Roll two dice. If the total is the same or less 
    than your <b>SKILL</b> score, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/81.html" hx-target="main">81</a>. 
    If the total is greater than your <b>SKILL</b> score, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/371.html" hx-target="main">371</a>.
