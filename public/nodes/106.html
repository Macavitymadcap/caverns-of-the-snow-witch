    Further ahead, in the left-hand wall of the tunnel, you see a gap. You walk 
    up to it and peer round to see a cave in which a NEANDERTHAL is stripping 
    the skin off a moose making it ready for the large simmering stew-pot behind 
    him. He is working very slowly and is being yelled at by the GNOME cook who 
    is wearing a white apron and waving a wooden spoon in the air. If you wish 
    to enter the crude kitchen, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/95.html" hx-target="main">95</a>. 
    If you would rather creep past the entrance, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/267.html" hx-target="main">267</a>.
