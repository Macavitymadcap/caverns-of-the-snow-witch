  <h2>133</h2>
  
  <p>
    You thrust out your hands and luckily manage to land on the floor without
    hurting yourself. As you pick yourself up, you suddenly hear footsteps
    coming from the depths of the cave. In the distance you can see a swaying
    light and the vague outline of a hunched, sinewy figure, who skulks slowly
    forward. If you wish to see who is coming towards you, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/37.html" hx-target="main">37</a>. If you would rather run
    out of the cave, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/355.html" hx-target="main">355</a>.
