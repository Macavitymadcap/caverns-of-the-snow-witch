    You find a magnificent sword clenched in the hand of one of the dead Trolls. 
    You unbend its fingers and take the finely crafted weapon. Its edge is keen 
    and without any effort you slice through a nearby branch. Add 1 <b>SKILL</b> 
    point. Redswift urges you to hurry in case there are more Trolls nearby 
    (turn to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/38.html" hx-target="main">38</a>).
