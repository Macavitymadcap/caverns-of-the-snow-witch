    The tunnel ends at a wooden door which opens when you turn the handle. You 
    walk into a massive high-ceilinged chamber which ends in a wall of ice. In 
    the centre of the chamber is an open marble sarcophagus with its lid propped 
    up against its side. A white rat suddenly jumps out of the sarcophagus and 
    runs towards you. It stops in front of you and starts to grow and change 
    shape. If you possess any ground minotaur horn, turn to

    If you do not, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/223.html" hx-target="main">223</a>.
