    There is no writing in the book, just a recess cut in the pages which holds 
    a talisman on a golden chain. The talisman is a jade frog. If you wish to 
    put the chain around your neck, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/327.html" hx-target="main">327</a>. 
    If you would prefer to leave it in the book, you may, if you have not done 
    so already, do one of the following:
  </p>

  <menu>
    <li>
      Blow the flute. Turn to 
      <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/74.html" hx-target="main">74</a>
    </li>

    <li>
      Read the runes on the stick. Turn to 
      <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/345.html" hx-target="main">345</a>
    </li>

    <li>
      Smell the rose. Turn to 
      <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/317.html" hx-target="main">317</a>
    </li>
  </menu>

  <p>
    If you do not wish to do any of the above, you may leave the cave and turn 
    left into the tunnel (turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/198.html" hx-target="main">198</a>).
