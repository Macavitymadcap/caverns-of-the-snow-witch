    The Dwarf gives a shriek of delight when the spear touches his hand
    and he pulls it out of the wall. He shouts, 'Come on, let's go and
    find some Trolls!'. He runs off into the tunnel and you realize that
    you have lost a friend. Lose 2 <b>LUCK</b> points. You decide to turn
    back to the fork and walk along the other branch of the tunnel (turn
    to <a hx-get="/nodes/29.html" hx-target="main">29</a>).
