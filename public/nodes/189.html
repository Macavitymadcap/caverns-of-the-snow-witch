    The Brain Slayer's disgusting tentacles flail frantically as it tries to 
    draw you towards it. Fortunately the amulet gives you the courage to resist 
    its attempt to hypnotize you. You draw your sword to attack the foul 
    creature. It releases Redswift and Stubb who fall to the floor clutching 
    their heads in agony.
