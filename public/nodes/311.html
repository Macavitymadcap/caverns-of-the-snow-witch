    The tunnel ends at the edge of a pit, out of which a Dwarf is trying 
    to climb, but he keeps on slipping back. The floor of the pit is 
    covered with large ice boulders which have crashed down from a shaft 
    above the pit. One lands on the Dwarf's shoulders and you hear wild 
    cheers from the top of the shaft as he tumbles on to the floor. The 
    Dwarf sees you and shouts, 'Curse you, stranger, if you do not aid 
    me. I see that you are not wearing a collar.' If you wish to help 
    the Dwarf out of the pit, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/376.html" hx-target="main">376</a>. If you would 
    rather ignore his pleas and walk back to the junction, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/57.html" hx-target="main">57</a>.
