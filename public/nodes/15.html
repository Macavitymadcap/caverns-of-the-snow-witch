    The Snow Witch stares at you for a long time before calling out 'Circle.'
    You smile and unfold your clenched fist, revealing the square metal disc.
    You have outwitted her and she realizes the consequences. The globe starts
    to fill with white smoke and suddenly it shatters, the image of the Snow
    Witch disappears. Her shrill cry fills the cavern, but she is defeated. The
    three of you slap each other's hands in celebration. However, your joy is
    short-lived as you hear an ominous rumbling. The ground be- neath your feet
    starts to tremble and huge cracks appear in the ice walls. The roof starts
    to cave in. Is this the chance to escape that the Snow Witch promised?
