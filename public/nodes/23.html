    The Snow Witch looks surprised and displeased by the defeat of her Zombies.
    Suddenly she says, 'The game we are going to play is called Discs. You will
    not win, of course. But in the unlikely event that you do, I will give you
    the chance to escape. I hope you have remembered to bring along your discs.
    Without them you lose!' She laughs sadistically at the thought of making up
    the rules on the spur of the moment. Nevertheless, you must play as
    directed. If you have any small metal discs, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/113.html" hx-target="main">113</a>. If you do not possess
    any discs, turn to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/40.html" hx-target="main">40</a>.
