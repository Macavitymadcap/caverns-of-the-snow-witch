  <h2>209</h2>

  <p>
    Feeling ill, you lie down in the sun and soon fall asleep. You wake up an 
    hour later but you do not feel any better - in fact, you feel worse. You 
    realize that the man who sold you the herbs was not the Healer, but an 
    opportunist sham. The hour you have wasted waiting for the fake remedy to 
    work has cost you dearly. Lose 3 <b>STAMINA</b> points. If you wish to go 
    back to the herbalist's hut, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/27.html" hx-target="main">27</a>. 
    If you would rather not waste any more time and continue up the river 
    valley, turn to <a hx-get="/nodes/205.html" hx-target="main">205</a>.
