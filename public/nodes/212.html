    The wind starts to howl, blowing gusts of snow into your face. You put your 
    head down and stride into it. Above the howl of the wind you suddenly become 
    aware of another sound - the howling of wolves. You draw your sword while 
    trying to peer through the snow. As if out of nowhere, two SNOW WOLVES 
    appear in front of you, hunched ready to pounce. They are completely white 
    except for their blood-red eyes. Suddenly one leaps at you. Fight them one 
    at a time.
