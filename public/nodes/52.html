  <p>
    You remember an old legend that ground minotaur horn is the only substance
    that can stop a metamorphosis spell from working. You quickly sprinkle some
    on the growing creature, and relax a little as it shrinks back to a white
    rat again. The legend was true! Intrigued by the open sarcophagus, you
    decide to walk over and examine it (turn to
