  <p>
    Thrusting your leg out to the side, you kick the nearest Goblin in the
    stomach. He doubles up, and an upper-cut to the jaw sends him crashing to
    the floor. The other Goblin lunges forward and tries to stab you with his
    dagger. Test your Luck. If you are Lucky, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/240.html" hx-target="main">240</a>. If you are Unlucky,
    turn to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/386.html" hx-target="main">386</a>.
