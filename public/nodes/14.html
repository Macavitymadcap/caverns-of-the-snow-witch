    The Genie appears, hovering above the Crystal Warrior. He snaps his fingers
    and you immediately become invisible. The Crystal Warrior Punches the air 
    with his rough quartz fists, but you are able to slip by him unnoticed. By

    adversary. Further on, the tunnel ends at a T-junction. If you wish to 
    go left, turn to
