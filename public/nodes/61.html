    As you walk along, the Elf introduces himself. 'My name is Redswift, and he 
    is known as Stubb,' he says, pointing to the smiling Dwarf. 'We met here as 
    slaves in the service of the vile Snow Witch. We both now hope to return to 
    our villages. I live in the Moonstone Hills and Stubb comes from 
    Stonebridge. If we manage to escape from these infernal caverns, you are 
    more than welcome to come and stay with us. Stonebridge is on the way to my 
    village in the hills. It's also a long way off.' Before Redswift can 
    continue, Stubb shouts and points to an orb lying on the floor. It is made 
    of glass and in the torchlight it seems to glow with swirling colours. 
    'Leave it,' commands Redswift, 'we do not need it and it could be a trap.' 
    If you wish to ignore Redswift's advice and pick up the orb, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/48.html" hx-target="main">48</a>. 
    If you would rather keep on walking, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/166.html" hx-target="main">166</a>.
