  <h2>90</h2>

  <p>
    Redswift and Stubb are not injured by the falling ice and they help you to 
    your feet. Above, you are surprised to see the welcome sight of blue sky. 
    The three of you waste no time clambering out of the ice cavern, and you 
    find yourselves on the side of the mountain. It is not even snowing and 
    everything looks tranquil. As you climb down the mountain, you tell your 
    friends about Big Jim Sun and the circumstances that led you to the caverns 
    of the Snow Witch. You realize that Big Jim would have presumed you were 
    dead; and you decide it is not worth chasing after him to collect your 
    reward for killing the Yeti. Without any further ado you agree to accompany 
    Redswift and Stubb to Stonebridge (turn to
