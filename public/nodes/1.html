    By the time you reach the outpost again, the bodies are blanketed with snow
    and the beast's footprints are covered over. The visibility is poor as you 
    set off towards the mountains where you hope to find the abominable killer 
    beast. The snow on the mountainside is soft and you sink in up to your 
    knees as you climb slowly up. You soon find yourself at the edge of a 
    crevasse which is spanned by an ice bridge. If you wish to cross the 
    crevasse by the ice bridge, turn to 
    <a class="btn" class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/335.html" hx-target="main">335</a>. 
    If you would rather walk around the crevasse, turn to 
    <a class="btn" class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/310.html" hx-target="main">310</a>.
