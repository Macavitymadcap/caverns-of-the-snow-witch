    The tunnel opens out into a small cavern which is empty apart from a brass 
    bowl resting on top of an ice plinth. The bowl contains a yellow liquid and
    a wooden ladle. If you wish to drink some of the liquid, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/24.html" hx-target="main">24</a>. If you would rather 
    walk back out of the cavern without drinking the liquid, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/56.html" hx-target="main">56</a>.
