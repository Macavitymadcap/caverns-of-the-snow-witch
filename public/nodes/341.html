  <h2>341</h2>

  <p>
    When you open the door, one of the man's eyes flicks open. He seems, 
    however, unconcerned at your intrusion and remains stretched out in 
    his rocking-chair. If you wish to ask him if he is the Healer, turn 
    to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/71.html" hx-target="main">71</a>. If you would 
    rather just tell him you are lost, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/334.html" hx-target="main">334</a>.
