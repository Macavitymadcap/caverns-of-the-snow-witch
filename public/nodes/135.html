    The tunnel ends at another door, an old piece of parchment is pinned on it.
    There is faded writing on the parchment, but you do not understand the
    language. Knowing that elves speak many languages, you ask Redswift to try
    to read it. As he reads, his eyes widen with terror. You ask him what is
    wrong, but he refuses to reply. He rips the parch- ment off the door and
    tears it into tiny pieces. He turns the door handle and says, 'Let's get
    going, there is no time to lose.' You and Stubb look at each other and
    shrug your shoulders, deciding simply to obey the troubled Redswift. The
    door opens into another tunnel. After walking down it for a few metres, you
    come to a place where water is dripping down continuously from stalactites
    overhead. If you have a shield, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/230.html" hx-target="main">230</a>. If you do not possess
    a shield, turn to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/79.html" hx-target="main">79</a>.
