  <h2>169</h2>

  <p>
    Underneath an overhanging rock, you see a small wooden hut built against the 
    side of the mountain. Its roof is piled high with snow and long icicles hang 
    down from the window ledges. You see a set of deep footprints leading from 
    the hut up the side of the mountain. If you wish to enter the hut, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/36.html" hx-target="main">36</a>. 
    If you would rather follow the footprints in the snow, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/190.html" hx-target="main">190</a>.
