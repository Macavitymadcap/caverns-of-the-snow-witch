    The Snow Witch laughs, saying, 'You are an amusing little fellow,
    but I have a game for you to play that you will not win.' She
    concentrates her power on Redswift and Stubb and their metal
    collars tighten. They both clutch their throats as if gasping for
    breath. You struggle to your feet, yelling insults at the Snow
    Witch, mocking her cowardly way of dealing with defenceless slaves.
    You challenge her to a combat, of whatever type she wishes. She
    releases her stranglehold on Redswift and Stubb, saying, 'Even
    though I have beaten you, I enjoy games. I will play!' Suddenly you
    hear the sound of shuffling footsteps coming from the tunnel opposite.
    An Elf and a Dwarf enter the cavern: they look almost identical to
    Redswift and Stubb except that their vacant looks and putrid white
    flesh indicate that they are both ZOMBIES. The Snow Witch tells you
    to fight them while she invents a game for you to play. The Zombies
    lumber forward and you are forced to fight the terrible replicas
    of your friends.

  <ul class="battle">
    <li>
      DWARF ZOMBIE SKILL 8 STAMINA 9
    </li>
    <li>
      ELF ZOMBIE SKILL 9 STAMINA 9
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Fight both the Zombies at the same time. Each will have a separate
    attack on you during each Attack Round, but you must choose which of
    the two you will fight. Attack your nominated target as in a normal
    battle. Against the other, you will throw for your Attack Strength
    in the normal way, but you will not wound it if your Attack Strength
    is greater; you must count this as though you have just parried its
    blow. Of course, if its Attack Strength is greater, it will have
    wounded you in the normal way. If you win, turn to
