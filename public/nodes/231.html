    The path winds steeply up the side of the hill. After half an hour of
    climbing you reach the top and look out over a wide plain. Suddenly you
    hear the thundering hooves of horses in the distance. You quickly look
    around for somewhere to hide. If you wish to hide between the stunted
    bushes, turn to <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/58.html" hx-target="main">58</a>. If
    you would rather climb a tree and hide in its branches, turn to
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/186.html" hx-target="main">186</a>.
