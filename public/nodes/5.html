    You instinctively church the hilt of your sword, as the Healer's words of 
    warning echo through your mind. Roll two dice. If the total is the same or 
    less than your <b>SKILL</b> score, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/98.html" hx-target="main">68</a>. If 
    the total is greater than your <b>SKILL</b> score, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/185.html" hx-target="main">185</a>.
