  <h2>176</h2>

  <p>
    The door opens into yet another tunnel and you begin to wonder whether you 
    will ever find your way out of the caverns of the Snow Witch. You look at 
    Redswift and Stubb, but they do not appear to be very concerned. The tunnel 
    soon ends at another door and you notice a dagger sticking out of its oak 
    panelling. If you wish to pull the dagger out of the door, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/55.html" hx-target="main">55</a>. 
    If you would rather open the door, turn to 
    <a hx-get="/nodes/285.html" hx-target="main">285</a>.
