  <p>
    After you have finished fighting the Orc, you walk into the next chamber.
    It is large and circular and full of the sounds of dripping water. The
    walls are covered with icicles and the light is dim. Across the chamber
    you see the shadow of a grotesque figure, a huge shape. It is a
    FROST GIANT.
