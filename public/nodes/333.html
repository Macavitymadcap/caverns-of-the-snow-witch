    You instinctively clutch the hilt of your sword as the Healer's 
    words of warning echo through your mind. Roll two dice and add 2 to 
    the total. If the total is the same or less than your <B>SKILL</B> 
    score, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/68.html" hx-target="main">68</a>. If the total is 
    greater than your <B>SKILL</B> score, turn to 
    <a class="btn" hx-get="/nodes/185.html" hx-target="main">185</a>.
