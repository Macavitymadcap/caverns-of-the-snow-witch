  <h2>
    Fighting Monsters
  </h2>

  <p>
    Before embarking on your adventure, you must first determine your own 
    strengths and weaknesses. You have in your possession a sword and a 
    backpack containing provisions (food and drink) for the trip. You have been
    preparing for your quest by training yourself in swordplay and exercising 
    vigorously to build up your stamina.
  </p>

  <p>
    To see how effective your preparations have been, you must use the dice to
    determine your initial <b>SKILL</b> and <b>STAMINA</b> scores. There is an
    Adventure Sheet which you may use to record the details of an adventure. On
    it you will find boxes for recording your <b>SKILL</b>, <b>STAMINA</b> and 
    <b>LUCK</b> scores.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Skill, Stamina and Luck
  </h3>

  <p>
    Roll one die. Add 6 to this number and enter this total in the <b>SKILL</b>
    box on the <i>Adventure Sheet</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Roll both dice. Add 12 to the number rolled and enter this total in the
    <b>STAMINA</b> box.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is also a <B>LUCK</B> box. Roll one die, add 6 to this number and 
    enter this total in the <B>LUCK</B> box.
  </p>

  <p>
    For reasons that will be explained below, <b>SKILL</b>, <b>STAMINA</b> and
    <b>LUCK</b> scores change constantly during an adventure. You 
    must keep an accurate record of these scores and for this reason you are 
    advised either to write small in the boxes or to keep an eraser handy. But 
    never rub out your <i>Initial</i> scores. Although you may be awarded 
    additional <b>SKILL</b>, <b>STAMINA</b> and <b>LUCK</b> points, these 
    totals may never exceed your <i>Initial</i> scores except on very rare 
    occasions, when you will be instructed on a particular page.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your <b>SKILL</b> score reflects your swordsmanship and general fighting 
    xpertise; the higher the better. Your <b>STAMINA</b> score reflects your
    general constitution, your will to survive, determination and overall 
    fitness; the higher your <b>STAMINA</b> score, the longer you will be able
    to survive. Your <b>LUCK</b> score indicates how naturally lucky a person 
    you are. Luck - and magic - are facts of life in the fantasy kingdom you 
    are about to explore.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Battles
  </h3>

  <p>
    You will often come across pages in the book which instruct you to fight a
    creature of some sort. An option to flee may be given, but if not - or if 
    you choose to attack the creature anyway - you must resolve the battle as
    described below.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First record the creature's <b>SKILL</b> and <b>STAMINA</b> scores in the
    first vacant Monster Encounter Box on your Adventure Sheet. The scores for 
    each creature are given in the book each time you have an encounter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The sequence of combat is then:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Roll both dice once for the creature. Add its <b>SKILL</b> This total is 
      the creature's Attack Strength score.
    </li>

    <li>
      Roll both dice once for yourself. Add the number rolled to your current 
      <b>SKILL</b> score This total is your Attack Strength.
    </li>

    <li>
      If your Attack Strength is higher than that of the creature, you have 
      wounded it. Proceed to step 4, If the creature's Attack Strength is 
      higher than it has wounded you. Proceed to step 5. If yours both Attack 
      Strength totals are the same, you have avoided each other's blows - start
      the next Attack Round from step 1 above.
    </li>

    <li>
      You have wounded the creature, so subtract 2 points from its 
      <b>STAMINA</b> score. You may use your <b>LUCK</b> here to do additional
      damage.
    </li>

    <li>
      The creature has wounded you, so subtract 2 points from your own 
      <b>STAMINA</b> score. Again you may use <b>LUCK</b> at this stage.
    </li>

    <li>
      Make the appropriate adjustments to either the creature's or your own 
      <b>STAMINA</b> scores (and your <b>LUCK</b> score if you used 
      <b>LUCK</b>).
    </li>

    <li>
      Begin the next Attack Round by returning to your current <b>SKILL</b> 
      score and repeating steps 1-6. This sequence continues until the 
      <b>STAMINA</b> score of either you or the creature you are fighting has 
      been reduced to zero (death).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>
    Escaping
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    On some pages you may be given the option of running away from a battle 
    should things be going badly for you. However, if you do run away, the 
    creature automatically gets in one wound on you subtract 2 <b>STAMINA</b> 
    points as you flee. Such is the price of cowardice. Note that you may use 
    <b>LUCK</b> on this wound in the normal way (seebelow). You may only Escape
    if that option is specifically given to you on the page.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Fighting More Than One Creature
  </h3>

  <p>
    If you come across more than one creature in a particular encounter the
    instructions on that page will tell you how to handle the battle. Sometimes
    you will treat them as a single monster; sometimes you will fight each one 
    in turn.
  </p>

  <h3>
    LUCK
  </h3>

  <p>
    At various times during your adventure, either in battles or when you come 
    across situations in which you could either be lucky or unlucky (details 
    of these are given on the pages themselves), you may call on your 
    <b>LUCK</b> to make the outcome more favourable. But beware! Using 
    <b>LUCK</b> is a risky business and if you are <i>un</i>lucky, the results 
    could be disastrous.
  </p>

  <p>
    The procedure for using your <b>LUCK</b> is as follows: roll two dice. If 
    the number rolled is equal to or less than your current <b>LUCK</b> score,
    you have been lucky and the result will go in your favour. If the number 
    rolled is higher than your current <b>LUCK</b> score, you have been unlucky 
    and you will be penalized.
  </p>

  <p>
    This procedure is known as <i>Testing your Luck</i>. Each time you 
    <i>Test your Luck</i>, you must subtract one point from your current 
    <b>LUCK</b> score. Thus you will soon realize that the more you rely on 
    your <b>LUCK</b>, the more risky this will become.
  </p>

  <h4>
    Using Luck in Battles
  </h4>

  <p>
    On certain pages of the book you will be told to <i>Test your Luck</i> 
    and will be told the consequences of your being lucky or unlucky. However, 
    in battles, you always have the option of using your <b>LUCK</b> either to
    inflict a more serious wound on a creature you have just wounded, or to 
    minimize the effects of a wound the creature has just inflicted on you.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have just wounded the creature: you may <i>Test your Luck</i>. If 
    you are Lucky, you have inflicted a severe wound and may subtract an extra
    2 points from the creature's <b>STAMINA</b> score. However, if you are 
    Unlucky, the wound was a mere graze and you must restore 1 point to the 
    creature's <b>STAMINA</b> (i.e. instead of scoring the normal 2 points of 
    damage, you have now scored only 1).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the creature has just wounded you: you may Test Luck to try to minimize 
    the wound. If you are Lucky, you have managed to avoid the full damage of 
    the blow. Restore 1 point of <b>STAMINA</b> (i.e. instead of doing 2 points 
    of damage it has done only 1). If you are Unlucky, you have taken a more 
    serious blow. Subtract 1 extra <b>STAMINA</b> point.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember that you must subtract 1 point from your <b>LUCK</b> score every 
    time you <i>Test your Luck</i>.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Restoring Skill, Stamina and Luck
  </h3>

  <h4>
    Skill
  </h4>

  <p>
    Your <b>SKILL</b> score will not change much during your adventure. 
    Occasionally, a page may give instructions to increase or decrease your 
    <b>SKILL</b> score. A Magic Weapon may increase your <b>SKILL</b>, but 
    remember that only one weapon can be used at a time! You cannot claim 2 
    <b>SKILL</b> bonuses for carrying two Magic Swords. Your <b>SKILL</b> score
    can never exceed its <i>Initial</i> value. Drinking the Potion of Skill 
    (see later) will restore your <b>SKILL</b> to its <i>Initial</i> level at
    any time.
  </p>

  <h4>
    Stamina and Provisions
  </h4>

  <p>
    Your <b>STAMINA</b> score will change a lot during your adventure as you 
    fight monsters and undertake arduous tasks. As you near your goal, your 
    <b>STAMINA</b> level may be dangerously low and battles may be particularly
    risky, so be careful!
  </p>

  <p>
    Your backpack contains enough Provisions for ten meals. You may rest and 
    eat at any time except when engaged in a Battle. Eating a meal restores 
    <b>STAMINA</b> points. When you eat a meal, add 4 points to your 
    <b>STAMINA</b> score and deduct 1 point from your Provisions. A separate 
    Provisions Remaining box is provided on the <i>Adventure Sheet</i> for 
    recording details of Provisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember that you have a long way to go, so use your Provisions wisely! 
    Remember also that your <b>STAMINA</b> score may never exceed its 
    <i>Initial</i> value unless specifically instructed otherwise. Drinking 
    the Potion of Strength will restore your <b>STAMINA</b> to its 
    <i>Initial</i> level at any time.
  </p>

  <h4>
    Luck
  </h4>

  <p>
    Additions to your <b>LUCK</b> score are awarded through the adventure when
    you have been particularly lucky. Details are given on the pages of this 
    book. Remember that, as with <b>SKILL</b> and <b>STAMINA</b>, your 
    <b>LUCK</b> score may never exceed its <i>Initial</i> value unless 
    specifically instructed. Drinking the Potion of Fortune will restore your 
    <b>LUCK</b> to its <i>Initial</i> level at any time, and increase your 
    <i>Initial</i> <b>LUCK</b> by 1 point.
