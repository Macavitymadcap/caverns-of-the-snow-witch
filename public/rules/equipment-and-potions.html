  <h2>
    EQUIPMENT AND POTIONS
  </h2>

  <p>
    You will start your adventure with a bare minimum of equipment, but you may 
    find or buy other during your travels. You are armed with a sword and are 
    dressed in leather armour. You have a backpack to hold your Provisions and 
    any treasure you may come across.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, you may take one bottle of a magic potion which will aid you 
    on your quest. You may choose to take a bottle of any of the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A Potion of Skill - restores <b>SKILL</b> points
    </li>

    <li>
      A Potion of Strength - restores <b>STAMINA</b> points
    </li>

    <li>
      A Potion of Fortune - restores <b>LUCK</b> points and adds 1 to 
      <i>Initial</i> <b>LUCK</b>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These potions may be taken at any time during your adventure (except when
    engaged in a Battle). Taking a measure of potion will restore <b>SKILL</b>,
    <b>STAMINA</b> or <b>LUCK</b> scores to their <i>Initial</i> level. The 
    Potion of Fortune will increase your <i>Initial</i> <b>LUCK</b> score by 1 
    point and restores to this new level.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each bottle of potion contains enough for <i>one</i> measure, i.e. the 
    characteristic may be restored once during an adventure. Make a note on 
    your <i>Adventure Sheet</i> when you have used up a potion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember also that you may only choose <i>one</i> of the three potions to
    take on your trip, so choose wisely!
