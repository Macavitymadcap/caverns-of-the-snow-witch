    HINTS ON PLAY
  </h2>

  <p>
    Your journey will be perilous and you are likely to fail on your first 
    attempt.Make notes and draw a map as you explore - this map will be 
    invaluable in future adventures and enable you to progress rapidly 
    through to unexplored sections.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not all areas contain treasure; many merely contain traps and creatures 
    which you will no doubt fall foul of. You may make wrong turnings during 
    your quest and while you may indeed progress through to your ultimate 
    destination, it is by no means certain that you will find what you are 
    searching for.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 'one true way' involves a minimum of risk and any player, no matter 
    how weak on initial dice rolls, should be able to get through fairly 
    easily.
  </p>

  <p>
    May the luck of the gods go with you on the adventure ahead!
